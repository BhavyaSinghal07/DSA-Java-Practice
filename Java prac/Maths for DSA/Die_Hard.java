// basically die hard is the water jug problem as given that 3,5 unit utensil and have to calculate 4 unit quanity
// to solve this problem we have to anlyse the equation form by the condition as: 3x + 5y = 4  , where 3 unit of x jug and 5 unit of y jug
// then find the min value for x & y jug so that it gives least +ve value, this is solve by hcf concept 
// HCF of a,b = min +ve value of eq ax + by where x&y are integers

/* Euclidean Algorithm: To find hcf and gcd
   gcd(a, b) = gcd(remainder(b, a), a)   ; ex: gcd(105, 224) = gcd(ren(224, 105), 105)
*/

// Extended Euclidean Algorithm also helps to find the value of x, y to solve die hard problems
