// In this question we find a number occur only once and ignore others which occur thrice
// note: this array only contains once or thrice occuring numbers

/* hamare paas jo array h agr usm saare no. 3 baar hi repeat hore h toh uske binary ka jo numeric sum hoga vo divisible by three hoga 
   ex: [2,2,2] it's binary is (10,10,10) jiska numeric sum 30 h jo divisible by 3 h
   Toh agr koi extra no. hua jo once occur h toh uske numeric sum ka % 3 for individually each bit of that numeric num gives the binary of that once occuring num
   ex: [2,2,2,3] it's binary is (10, 10, 10, 11) jiska numeric sum h 41 % 3 = (11) "in binary for each bit" and it's decimal value is 3 hence ans is 3
